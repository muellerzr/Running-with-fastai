# Running with fastai

Potential ideas/topics/general theme:

* Debugging issues (one lecture on this alone)
* Reading and learning the source code, how the library is built, _efficiently_ etc (likely the first lecture)
* Applying different levels of torch code and fastai code, and slowly integrating in more and more.
  * Similar to the Migration guides in the docs
  * Potential here to finally do keypoint heatmaps
  * Exploring IceVision, fasthugs, and other related libraries. Guest speakers from said libraries to discuss their headaches, solutions, etc
* Deployment scenarios:
  * All library vs some vs none, how to do what and where
* fastai_minima?
* Optimizers, training loop / schedulers


Basically getting stranger and stranger to help people see just what all you can do
Like teacher/student models (probably via Distilled ViT), handling complex situations with the Callback system

Perhaps also a lecture on contributing to fastai, what the workflow is like, etc
MixedDL is definitely going to be in there as well
