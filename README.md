# new_course

Potential ideas/topics/general theme:

* Debugging issues (one lecture on this alone)
* Reading and learning the source code, how the library is built, _efficiently_ etc (likely the first lecture)
* Applying different levels of torch code and fastai code, and slowly integrating in more and more.
  * Similar to the Migration guides in the docs
  * Potential here to finally do keypoint heatmaps
  * Exploring IceVision, fasthugs, and other related libraries. Guest speakers from said libraries to discuss their headaches, solutions, etc


Basically getting stranger and stranger to help people see just what all you can do
Like teacher/student models (probably via Distilled ViT), handling complex situations with the Callback system

Perhaps also a lecture on contributing to fastai, what the workflow is like, etc
MixedDL is definitely going to be in there as well
